## A Will and a Way (to deal with me)

Heya! Welcome to the team.

Every place takes a while to get used to. We're going to have different processes, different code bases, different relationships than your last place,and that's ok!. I know you're going to want to jump and show us how great you are, but you already did in the interview ;) Take the time you need to get to know the people, the code, and every acronym at the company.

One of the working relationships we need to define is ours. This is a guide to me, my process (and sometimes lack of process), my morals, and how we'll interact through the week. My intent is to accelerate our working relationship with this document.

## A Normal Week

Every week we'll have a 1on1 for at least 30 minutes. This meeting is for you and your growth; while I'll normally come with a topic or two and general feedback, they are secondary to any topics you have. This is *not* a status update. We have other meetings and processes for that.  It’s an opportunity to talk about your career goals and how we can work together to reach them.  I will help you advance your career, but this works best when its **directed and driven by you**. 

If you need to talk before our 1on1 please just grab me or slack me. I may ask if I can push to later, but if you say that conversation needs to happen right then, I believe you.  **These are my most important task in this role, and take priority.**

You can Slack me 24 hours a day. If you do not do a direct ping, I will take a while to answer. If you do directly ping me... I may take a while to answer. If it's important feel free to call me. My phone # is in my slack profile.

I use Slack as an async message board, so I'll post sometimes on the weekends. I'll also drop stuff in there for the next business day, but unless its an emergency I won’t @name you outside of business hours. I also do not expect you to respond after work hours.

I take vacations, and try to disconnect completely during them. Recharge time is important, and I will push you to take your PTO.

## North Star Principles

These are my personal principles, not official company ones.  

**Be Passionate** I think the best work is done when someone passionate is working on it. It will get done quicker, be better thought through, more polished, etc etc etc. It's hard to find that person unless you tell me its you! I'll try to be as visible as possible about what we'll work on so you can tell me when something sounds interesting. I promise to try and optimize for things you want to build.

**Question Everything** Just because something exists in a current way today, doesn't mean that it's the best form of it. Aim for perfection, and then scale back to what's reasonable.

**Bias toward action** My view of managers hasn't changed since I've become one; we're a tax on the company. One of the biggest dangers of that is if and when I become a blocker for you or the team. We hire smart people for their autonomy; if you believe we need to do something NOW (release, work on the next feature, fix a bug) don't wait for permission. Instead bias towards action and ask for forgiveness instead.

**Users First** I'm a huge UX person, and believe that the intangible "wow" factor makes the product win users' hearts and market share. This means one of my top concerns is user problems and amazing UX. This can cause tension with people who are more business or metric focused; trust me, I believe in those as well, they are just not my default.

**Leave it better than you found it** If we're constantly making small iterative improvements in the quality of our codebase, it makes it so much nicer to work in. This also applies to life, so we should grow ourselves and coworkers too. 

**Radical trust** I trust people to know their limits better then I do, so from day 1 I'll rely on you to tell me where and what they are. And once we've found where they are, I'll work with you to expand them! If you *ever* feel like there isn't trust, we've had a breakdown in communication. Please raise it so we can rebuild the trust between us.

## Feedback

Feedback fosters growth and keeps people happy.  This is also an area I’m actively working on improving on, so please give me feedback about my feedback!

I like to have more frequent touchpoints then yearly or biyearly for reviews. If you only hear about something every 6 months, how can you know if you're improving?

We have a semi formal feedback cycle once a month called Small Improvements.  You’ll get an email each month about it. It’s monthly so we feel more comfortable giving each other feedback as often as possible. Some of this feedback will be technical, but most of that will happen in PRs.  This will mainly be soft  / professional skills (communication, leadership, ect).

During our 1on1s, one of my default topics in my back pocket is feedback for you. I would rather give it ASAP then wait for SI.  

If you disagree with any of my feedback, please mention it. It may mean that we’ve had a breakdown in communication somewhere else, which is a completely different issue to work on. It also may mean I'm just wrong about it :)

“Disagreement is feedback and the sooner we learn how to efficiently disagree with each other, the sooner we’ll trust and respect each other more. Ideas don’t get better with agreement.” -RandsInRepose, the brilliant manager I stole this doc idea from.


## Meetings

I tend to be in a lot of meetings. Please ask me if you have a question about it or are interested in the topic; my calendar is open for a reason. 

My ideal meeting has a defined agenda for the meeting ahead of time, clear next steps by the end, was not possible IRL or by email, and a max of 8 people. If we need another meeting, we messed up (either we didn't book enough time, or didn't have a clear agenda). Running meetings is an area I'm actively improving on, so please hold me accountable.

We should always start on time. Everyone's time is equally important. If a meeting starts to go over, I will leave to avoid being late for other people. I am trying to be more aware and active about this, so please call me out when I fail. I also encourage everyone here to do the same.

If you send me a deck or doc before the meeting to pre-read 24 hrs in advance, I promise to do so. If its less than that, I'll do my best but make no guarentees (unless I explicitly promise after you've told me).

If we complete our goal before the meetings supposed to end, let's give the time back to everyone. If we aren't going to achieve it, then we should spend the last bit figuring out how to continue and ending on time.

## Habits and Nuance 

**I am an introvert** even though I seem outgoing at times. Prolonged exposure to humans is tiring. The bigger the group the quicker it happens, so if after a long day I retreat to my headphones and work don't be offended. It also means I'm more likely to speak up in smaller groups (although I try to fight this bad habit in bigger ones).

**I play devil's advocate** This happens more the harder someones pushes on a topic. I also do it more the better I know you, and in 1on1 situations.

**When I ask you to do something that feels poorly defined** you should ask me for both clarification and the priority of it. I might still be brainstorming. These questions can save everyone a lot of time.

**My default state is informal** I believe in a minimum of process whenever possible. Sometimes I go to far on that spectrum. I also have a laid back attitude by default, and sometimes I swear. Sorry in advance about that last bit!

**I truly appreciate feedback** and I am trying to be more proactive at coaxing it. I promise to listen fully, and ask clarification. If you don't think I am, please call me on it and let’s fix that bit of communication. If you don't feel comfortable telling me, please bring it up in your skip 1on1. 

If you disagree with anything in this document, please let me know. These are my ideals of who I want to be, so knowing where to improve would be awesome.
